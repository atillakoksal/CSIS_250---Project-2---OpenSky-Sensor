## CSIS_250--Project-2--OpenSky-Sensor
Use of **Open Sky Sensor REST API** with jSON and python code to retrieve aircraft make/model and vectors to be published in GHOST cms.  The sensor retrieves aircraft vectors from the [OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html#request) that are available within a nearly [49 square miles air space](https://github.com/atillakoksal/CSIS_250---Project-2---OpenSky-Sensor/blob/master/images/BB_area_map.PNG) (bounding box), center being the Grossmont College.  For each aircraft in the bounding box, aircraft make/model, speed, altitude, vertical rate, headed direction, current longtitude & latitude are retrieved or computed.
