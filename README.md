# CSIS_250---Project-2---OpenSky-Sensor
Use of Open Sky Sensor REST API with jSON and python code to retrieve aircraft make/model and vectors to be published in GHOST cms.  The sensor retrieves aircraft vectors from the <a ref="https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html#requestOpenSky"><OpenSky Network API</a> that are available within a 49 square miles air space (bounding box), center being the Grossmont College.  For each aircraft in the bounding box, aircraft make/model, speed, altitude, vertical rate, headed direction, current longtitude & latitude are retrieved or computed.
